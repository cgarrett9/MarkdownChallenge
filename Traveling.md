# Traveling

One of my favorite things to do is to travel around the country with my girlfriend Brooke.
We have visted a lot of cool places this summer.

Including

1. Zion National Park
2. Grand Canyon National Park
3. Mount Rushmore
4. Smokey Mountain National Park
5. Chicago

I am excited to visit plenty more National Parks in the future.
