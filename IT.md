## IT

I am excited to complete my bachelors degree in Information Technology in the near future.
I have learned a lot this semester in the field.
Here is an example of code I have written this semester in this class.

```
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Chris Garrett's SVG</h1>
        <svg width="350" height="250">
            <rect x="50" y="25" width="200" height="200" style="fill:teal; stroke:black" />
        </svg>
    </body>
</html>
```
